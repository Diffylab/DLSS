# DLSS
Super Sampling Images to 16 Times Their Resolution using Convolutional Neural Networks <br/>

# Inspiration
This [Computerphile Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DPRt3AcUEY) inpsired me to try to code a DLSS program

# Results
The original images are 64x64. I compared standard interpolation to my Deep Learned Super Sampling program
