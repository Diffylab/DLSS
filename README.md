# DLSS
Super Sampling Images to ```16``` Times Their Resolution using Convolutional Neural Networks <br/>

# Inspiration
This [Computerphile Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DPRt3AcUEY) inpsired me to try to code a DLSS program

# Results
I compared [Nearest Neighbor](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.resize) Interpolation to my Deep Learned Super Sampling program <br/>
Here I am upsampling from ```64x64``` to ```256x256``` which is equivalent to increasing the resolution by ```16``` times
